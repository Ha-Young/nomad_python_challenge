# Challenge goals:
Using the [boilerplate](https://repl.it/@serranoarevalo/Day-Five-Blueprint), make a program that gets a list of countries from a website with their currency codes, then let the user choose a country and display the currency code of that country.
This is part one of a bigger "country scrapping" project we will complete in the following days.

# 조건
This is how the program should work: [watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/Nh7nkjF.mp4)
- The website you should get the countries and currencies from is: https://www.iban.com/currency-codes
- Save the name of the country and the "Alpha-3 code" in an array.
- Some countries don't have currency (No universal currency), don't add them to the list.
- Check the user input, only numbers from inside the country list are allowed.
- When a country is selected, show the name and currency code.
- 힌트1: Use try/except when converting strings to numbers. ( int(input()) )
- 힌트2: [Index in 'for' loops?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522563/accessing-the-index-in-for-loops)
