조건
You need to complete the following functions:

- add_to_dict
- get_from_dict
- update_word
- delete_from_dict

  All this functions should check for errors, follow the comments to see all cases you need to cover. There should be NO ERRORS from Python in the console. NOT change anything inside of the "DO NOT TOUCH AREA"
